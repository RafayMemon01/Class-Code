            <h1>Mazar-e-Quaid</h1>
            <p>Mazar-e-Quaid (Urdu: مزارِ قائد, lit. 'Tomb of the Leader'), also known as Jinnah Mausoleum or the National Mausoleum, is the final resting place of <span class="brown-text">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</span>, the founder of Pakistan. Designed in a 1960s modernist style, it was completed in 1971, and is an iconic symbol of Karachi as well as one of the most popular tourist sites in the city.[1] The mausoleum complex also contains the tomb of Jinnah's sister, Māder-e Millat ("Mother of the Nation") Fatima Jinnah, as well as those of Liaquat Ali Khan and Nurul Amin, the first and eighth Prime Ministers of Pakistan respectively. The tomb of Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar, a stalwart of the Muslim League from Peshawar, is also located there.</p>
